# inherited-figures.sh — find MEASUREMENTS a surface inherited rather than re-derived.
#
# The defect this exists for: a number is copied plan -> report -> PR body ->
# handoff prompt and re-derived at none of them. Provenance labels do not catch
# it; the label is usually present and simply names a run that is no longer the
# current one. What discriminates it is head-relative staleness — the same digits
# survive unchanged while the commit they describe moves.
#
#   inherited-figures.sh <new-surface> <prior-surface> [<prior-surface>...]
#   inherited-figures.sh <draft-body> --pr 150        # adds the PR's published body
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow. It matches a number ONLY when bound to a
# measurement word (passed/failed/skipped/suites/files/lines/s/ms/queries/rows/…),
# so issue references, dates, phase numbers and session ids do not drown the
# signal. An earlier draft matched every 2+ digit number and produced 29 hits on
# a real PR body, nearly all noise — a check people switch off is worth nothing.
#
# Exits 1 if any inherited measurement is found. They are not necessarily wrong;
# they are UNAUDITED. Re-derive each at the current head, or say why it is
# head-independent.
#
# What this does NOT catch, stated so it is not oversold: a correct number under
# a wrong label (#87), a correctly-derived counterfactual printed as Observed
# (#107), or a prose claim with no numeral in it at all (2026-08-18's "GitHub
# retargets automatically"). It catches the copying, which is the mechanism the
# numeric instances shared. For the gate line specifically, prefer record-gate.sh,
# which removes the opportunity instead of auditing it.
#
# It also does not reach a figure bound to no unit word, and its duration matcher
# drops a minute prefix — 1m22.325s and a bare 22.325s reduce to the same key, so
# a genuinely distinct pair of durations can read as one inherited figure and a
# genuinely shared one can be missed. Do not describe its output as EVERY shared
# measurement; it is every measurement it can bind to a unit word or a duration.
#
# Restored in-repo 2026-09-04 (ledger L2), with two changes to the destroyed
# version: --pr fetches the published body (the surface that is NOT in the
# working tree, and the one #121's retired claim survived on), and a missing
# prior surface is a printed note and exit 0 rather than a usage error — a
# docs-only PR has no implementation report, and a check that errors on the
# ordinary case gets removed from the skill that calls it.
